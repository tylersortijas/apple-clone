# Description
An Apple clone site I used with Tailwind for the first time. Created in conjunction with React, it was a very fun learning experience. Looking back already there are things I would do differently. This took me about 12 hours to do and I'm proud of how it turned out so far. I still need to make the site responsive, but that will come soon. I mainly wanted to focus on how to adapt to tailwind and produce a quality landing page. 

# Future Updates
- Responsive Design
- Reorganized Component Layout
- Dropdown menu nav
- Carousel
